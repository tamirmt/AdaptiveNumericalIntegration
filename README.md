## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and numerical experiments for the project on **Adaptive Numerical Integration**. The main goal is to demonstrate the theoretical ideas behind adaptive quadrature and reproduce the experiments described in the accompanying PDF report.

Adaptive numerical integration improves efficiency by refining the mesh only where the integrand is difficult—such as near steep gradients, sharp peaks, or oscillatory regions—while keeping a coarse mesh elsewhere. This leads to higher accuracy with fewer function evaluations compared to classical fixed-step quadrature.
